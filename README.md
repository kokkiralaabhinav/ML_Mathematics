# ML_Mathematics
Machine learning is powered by four critical concepts and is Statistics, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus. While statistical concepts are the core part of every model, calculus helps us learn and optimize a model.

Behind every ML success there is Mathematics. All ML models are constructed using solutions and ideas from math. The purpose of ML is to create models for understanding thinking.

ML supports three types of ML models: binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression.
